Changes the wording for voice call permissions, improving consistency and clarity.

- `Manage Voip Extension` -> `Manage Voice Calls`
  > Permission to manage voice calls and assign extensions to users
- `View VoIP extension details` -> `View Voice Call Extensions`
  > Permission to view which user is calling and their extension info
- `View User VoIP extension` -> `Allow Voice Calls`
  > Permission to allow users to use the voice call feature
